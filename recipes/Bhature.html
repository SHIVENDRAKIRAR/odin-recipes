    Chole Bhature is a popular North Indian dish that combines spicy chickpea curry (chole) with fluffy deep-fried bread
    (bhature). Loved for its rich flavors and hearty texture, it’s a perfect meal for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. This
    dish is often associated with celebrations, street food culture, and the warmth of homemade meals. Packed with
    proteins from chickpeas and served with tangy pickles, fresh onions, and yogurt, it’s a wholesome treat that’s both
    indulgent and nutritious.
